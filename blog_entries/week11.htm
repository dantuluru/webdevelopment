<h3>Week11</h3>

<p>In my project, I will be using the following main Javascript libraries</p>
<ul>
    <li>jquery</li>
    <li>jquery-ui: To create tabs</li>
    <li>leaflet.js: To show map</li>
    <li>jqPlot: To create plot</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be using the following api's</p>
<ul>
    <li>fcc.gov api to get block, county, state information</li>
    <li>census.gov api to get various metrics based on block, county, state information</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>When a user clicks on the map, we get the county and state information by using the latitude and longitude to query the fcc.gov api.
    The county and state information is then used to query the census.gov api to get the population for different races in the county.
    The data is then plotted as a bar chart.
